#  Pokémon Data Analysis – Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project explores a structured Pokémon dataset to analyze offensive, defensive, and generational performance trends. The goal is to extract actionable insights from multi-dimensional Pokémon attributes such as type, stats, and evolution.

---

## **Problem**
The Pokémon dataset contains multiple numerical and categorical attributes across generations, making it challenging to interpret trends in attack, defense, speed, HP, and overall stats without proper analysis.  

Key challenges include:  
- Multi-dimensional features for primary and secondary types  
- Missing or inconsistent values in stats  
- Complex relationships across generations  

---

## **Solution**
An end-to-end data analysis pipeline was implemented to:  

- **Data cleaning:** Handle missing values and inconsistencies in Pokémon stats  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Inspect distributions and relationships between attributes  
- **Statistical analysis:** Compute metrics such as mean, median, max, and min across primary and secondary types  
- **Data visualization:** Use bar charts and heatmaps to highlight offensive, defensive, and generational trends  

---

## **Outcome**
The analysis provided key insights such as:  

- Dragon types demonstrated the highest average attack  
- Steel types had the highest average defense  
- Flying types were the fastest among secondary types  
- Trends in base stats across generations, showing evolution of strength for different types  

This project demonstrates strong skills in **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, **statistical computation**, and **data visualization** using Python tools.
